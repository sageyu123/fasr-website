        FASR is being developed as a **university-led consortium** anchored at the [New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT)](https://www.njit.edu/), working in partnership with universities, national observatories/laboratories, and international research institutions. NJIT serves as the lead institution, coordinating the project and providing administrative and organizational support.

        The consortium model ensures that FASR benefits from the broad expertise of the solar physics, radio astronomy, and space weather communities. Partner institutions contribute to key elements of the project—including antenna design, digital systems, software pipelines, science planning, and education and outreach—while sharing governance through a collaborative council representing the participating organizations.

        FASR also works closely with external collaborators, including international observatories, data and modeling groups, and industry partners who bring specialized technical capabilities and scientific expertise. These collaborations strengthen FASR’s design and expand the scientific and technological impact of the project.

        FASR is committed to being an **open, community-driven facility**. We welcome participation from institutions and individuals across the solar and heliophysics community. Contributions may include scientific expertise, technical development, software, data-analysis tools, student engagement, or participation in working groups. Prospective collaborators are encouraged to contact the project leadership to discuss opportunities to join the effort.

        Those interested in engaging with the project are warmly invited to [join the FASR community Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/ovsa-fasr/shared_invite/zt-3clb7g6f8-R_XP1jYDzZsU0bzGs1xJjg) to connect with the team and stay informed about current activities.
