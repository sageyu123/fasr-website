There will be a FASR presentation at the 2025 American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting Town Hall titled "Magnetic Reconnection Research: Challenges, Breakthroughs, and Future Missions" (Session #: TH35A). Please join us!

Town Hall Title: Magnetic Reconnection Research: Challenges, Breakthroughs, and Future Missions
Date and Time: Wednesday, 17 December 2025: 18:00 - 19:00 CST
Location: New Orleans Convention Center, Room: 294 
Session #: TH35A

Description: Magnetic reconnection is a universal plasma process that powers solar flares, geomagnetic storms, auroral particle acceleration, and cross-scale energy transfer across space and laboratory plasmas. With the new generation of missions and laboratory facilities coming online, the community is entering a transformative period for reconnection science. This Town Hall brings together leading researchers to discuss the future trajectory of magnetic reconnection research, with a focus on emerging cross-disciplinary opportunities in space, laboratory, and computational plasma physics. Attendees will hear perspectives on the most pressing scientific questions, recent breakthroughs, and the key enabling technologies that will shape the study in the next decade. Featured new and upcoming Missions & Facilities includes FLARE, TREX, SMILE, LEXI, FASR, TRACERS, and SMWF. There will be short presentations from mission and facility leads, discussion on scientific priorities, open floor for community input on research directions, and cross-disciplinary dialogue among space, solar, laboratory, and computational researchers. This Town Hall aims to define community-driven research priorities, strengthen collaboration across programs, and accelerate mission-driven science for the next decade of magnetic reconnection research. Plese join us for a forward-looking discussion and help shape the future of this critical/exciting field. p.s., simple snacks & drinks are provided. Town Hall conveners, Jongsoo Yoo (Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory), Kevin Genestreti (Southwest Research Institute), Yi-Hsin Liu (Dartmouth College).
